## About This Project

This is my **very first Swift project** that I created while learning Swift and SwiftUI. Itâ€™s a simple but practical Tip Calculator app that helped me understand fundamental concepts of iOS development such as:

- Using SwiftUI to build user interfaces declaratively
- Managing state with @State properties
- Handling user input with TextField and Stepper controls
- Implementing data validation and showing alerts
- Working with basic computations and updating the UI dynamically
- Understanding layout and styling with stacks, padding, colors, and modifiers
- Using ScrollView to ensure content fits on smaller screens

## Features

- Enter the bill amount
- Choose tip percentage with a slider (0% to 30%)
- Select number of people to split the bill using a stepper (1 to 20)
- Calculates total tip, total amount, and amount per person
- Validates input and shows alert for invalid entries
